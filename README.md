# Diabetes Prediction Model

This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical data such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and more. The goal is to use machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to make predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook `diabetes_prediction_model.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and contains data about patients' medical information, including features such as age, glucose levels, BMI, etc.

## Usage Example
After running the notebook, the model will predict whether a person has diabetes based on the input features and display the result.

## Results/Performance
- Logistic Regression accuracy: 80%
- KNN accuracy: 78%
